# Mandelbrot Generator
This project is about visualizing the Mandelbrot set. 

```bash
make 

# xsize = image width
# ysize = image height
# minRe = real part of the smalles possible Mandelbrot number in our visualization
# maxRe = real part of the biggest possible Mandelbrot number in our visualization
# minIm = imaginary part of the smalles possible Mandelbrot number in our visualization
# maxIm = imaginary part of the biggest possible Mandelbrot number in our visualization
./generate 600 200 -1 2 -1 1 
```
